#REQUIRES UPDATING EACH YEAR
#There are three types of special missings:
# -99 = REFUSED TO ANSWER SURVEY
##      A value of -99 is assigned for states that left data blank or submitted NAs (did not submit any data)
# -88 = MISSING DATA INTENTIONALLY
##      A value of -88 is assigned for states that submitted 0's, NA's or left data blank *intentionally*
# -77 = DATA DOESN'T EXIST
##      A value of -77 is assigned for states where parole was abolished
